# ForwardCurveAPI
Forward Curve calculation using C# and Python

Example of how a dll can be created in Visual Studio C# using the System.Dynamic namespace which can then be called from Python using the clr namespace. 
This shows a forward curve being created from a spot yield curve which leverages the increased efficiency of using a compiled C# dll relative to using all Python code.
